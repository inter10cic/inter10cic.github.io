Real basics of machine learning are comprised of labels, features, and models.

In general, machine learning systems are "taught" to use various kinds of inputs in producing socially useful predictions about numerous sets of data.

There are two sets of fundamental terminologies in machine learning: 1) labels and 2) features. 

These two terms comprise of what is known as linear regression. Linear regression normally shows the relationship between x- and y- variables. 
For example, the longer the distance you run, the higher the amount of water you will want to drink. 
Mathematically, this can be thought of as the value of an independent variable (x) affecting the value of a dependent variable (y). 
A simple linear regression models this relationship between x- and y- variables. This is where the machine learning principle lies. 

__Labels__:
These are the things that we _predict_: the result values of y. It can be literally _anything_.

__Features__:
These are the inputs, or the x- variables. Usually, a complex machine learning system consists of millions of kinds of features.
